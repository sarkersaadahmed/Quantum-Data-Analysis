xlookup mode 


"*"& column choice -> anything that has column choice name or anything after whatever symbols or characters exist
column choice "*"&  -> anything that has column choice name or anything before whatever symbols or characters exist


xlookup(choice column, range of column, range of other choice column,, 1 [either 
next to smaller value or next to larger vvalue [as in the name of the person after or before the choice column]]
it will search that specific column if the date after the choice date exists

just like how lists are being searched in pythn one by one

same thing for xlookup(choice column, range of column, range of other choice column,,, 1 but the difference is
that here it either iterates through every column by binary search or by normal search [ascending from top to 
bottom] or descending [from bottom to top]]
